          <p>Thursday, October 31st. The city streets are crowded for the holiday.<br>Even with the rain. Hidden in the chaos is the element, waiting to strike like snakes. <br>And I'm there too. Watching. 2 years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal. <br>I must choose my targets carefully. It's a big city. I can't be everywhere. But they don't know where I am. <br>We have a signal now, for when I'm needed. When that light hits the sky, it's not just a call- it's a warning. To them. Fear is a tool. <br>They think I'm hiding in the shadows. But I AM the shadows. <br>I wish I could say I'm making a difference, but I don't know. Murder, robberies, assault- 2 years later, they're all up. And now this. <br>This city's eating itself. Maybe it can't be saved, but i have to try. PUSH MYSELF. These nights all roll together in a rush, Behind the mask. <br>Sometimes in the morning i have to force myself to remember everything that happened.<br>
